Understand this before starting: each execution may provide a result that is chained as input to the next step or not. This is contextual -- you will not receive guidance about this, but you must always execute the sequence provided. Sometimes tools will return notifications about file writes. In that case, either the next step or a step later can/might include a param requiring that file. You may sometimes have to read the files to get the context for the params. The tool descriptions in the declarations sometimes provide you hints about what to expect.",
